Continuous Deployment Pipeline

1. Complete steps 1-6 from CI Pipeline.  Since this is a deployment 
Pipeline, the shift-left checks will also include any
special checks needed for Prod deployments.

2.  Gather any approvals needed before production deployment.

3.  Production canary deployment.  Provides a manual rollback option during deployment plus automatically rolls back
if error threshold is too high.  Feature flags may also be used to further reduce risk.
